# Project Title: Donation Campaign



## Project Features

Certainly, here are few important project features for Donation Campaign:

#### User Interaction:: 
Ensure that users can easily access to the all Donation Cards from the homepage to a dedicated section of the application.
  

#### User Interface (UI) Design:
- Design the donation cards: Create a visually appealing card for each donation item or campaign. Include essential information such as the donation title, image, category and a details.

- Design the donation details view: Create a separate page or window where users can view the detailed information about a donation when they click the donation card in the homepage.
- Design a statistics page: Create a separate statistics page where the pie chart will be displayed to the donated items and total donation items as percentage. 

#### Functionality:
   - Implement a click event handler for each donation card. When a user clicks on a card, it should trigger an action to display the donation details.

- When a user clicks the "Show All" button, the application will trigger a process to retrieve and display all the donated cards or items in a single, scrollable list.

- Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort search results based on categories.

#### Testing:
Thoroughly test the functionality to ensure that all donated cards are displayed accurately.

#### Responsiveness:
Make the user interface responsive to various screen sizes and devices.

*These features should help improve the user experience.*
